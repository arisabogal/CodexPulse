# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Report unacceptable behavior by contacting the maintainers through a private
security advisory or direct maintainer contact if available. All reports will
be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
